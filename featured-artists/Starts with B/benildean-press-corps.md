# The Benildean

**Country:** Philippines

The Benildean, or the Benildean Press Corps (BPC for short), is a Philippine student journalist paper. I personally worked under BPC for two years as a Graphic Designer, and when most of my work there was not involved in branding or logo work, I was mostly involved with creating collages. Collages, due to their easier form than illustration, are often used in commercial or journalistic settings to easily add a little flavor or support to the actual, primary content on the page. But the collages from BPC have really grown in the past few years, taking a more artistic leaning, with plenty of them able to display the meaning of the article without that article's context. In other words: they stand on their own, and are worth highlighting as collage works and as pieces of art themselves (even without my bias.)

The works shown here range from article banners, holiday visuals, magazine artworks, to promotional materials. All these are done by my peers: Lia Dimalanta, Mikael Hilapo, Gil Escorial, Yohanna Mendoza, and Tine Dumdumaya.
