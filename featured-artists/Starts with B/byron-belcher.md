# Byron Belcher

**Country:** USA

Byron Belcher is an international digital & analog collage artist. My first exposure to his art was when I saw this [artwork](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSugRLuJBa-/) on my Explore page, and ever since then I've been a fan. As a Spider-Man fan, this was an [instant love](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoP6-zjJj2_/) for me too.

> <h3>"I like to use collage as an art form because I enjoy the process of making something new from something preexisting. It's always exciting finding old images that inspire me and figuring out what I can do to bring them together in a satisfying and creative way."</h3>
