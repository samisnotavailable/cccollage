# Julia Hao

**Country:** Philippines

Published in several local and international publications and competitions, Julia Hao is a remarkable and promising writer, and her creativity shows in her collage artworks as well. Her collages are clean, minimalist, and focused on establishing silhouettes rather than filling up the canvas. Pointed towards womanhood, writing, and relationships, Julia's approach to her artworks feel almost similar to her writing: they're an identification, a critique of the self and the surrounding contexts which we live in, but also an embrace of her own identity, as a means of helping her viewers recognize their own. 

Right now, Julia Hao is undertaking her thesis as a creative writer, specializing in nonfiction. I'll proudly include a link to it here once it's publicly available. If and once available, along with her other writings, do give the love of my life's works a read.
