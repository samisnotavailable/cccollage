# Alex Eckman-Lawn

**Country:** USA

Stumbling upon an Alex Eckman-Lawn artwork was one of the most delightful online finds I've ever had. His work is concentrated on analogue work, creating multi-layered, hand-cut collages of both his own illustration work and archival materials. What makes his collages so unique are the iconic central cavities embedded in them: a hole, a missing part in which something horrific rots and aches to be discovered. Most often dealing with the subject matter of bodies, his artworks are therefore inherently personal in their horror, while also deliberately surgical in how he exposes that horror through depth. His work has appeared not just as prints and album covers, but as comic illustrations and cover art as well.
