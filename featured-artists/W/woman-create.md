# Woman Create

Woman Create makes a lot of things, but collages are how I came to find her. Her method with collage is a lot of cutting, divying up even the smallest portions and arranging them around the canvas as if they're floating brushstrokes. She uses different material, not just physical paper but even beads, strings, and other textures to make her collages burst forth from the page. Nothing quite like them honestly, and it's a level of craft that I am so floored by. She recently created a zine called "Kwento Karma", which explores visual and written introspections of female rage. It recently debuted in Taipei Art Book Fair, and I'm hoping it gets a wider release soon.

> <h3>"An interesting thing to note about the collage medium is its capability to produce a seemingly diverse number of interpretations about one specific image or object, depending on the preferences or experiences of the person looking. This means that in a group of 10 tasked to work on interpretation of one same image (for example, an image of an apple), all 10 will have different interpretations, methods of collaging, and ideas of its transformed version. We are all looking at the same thing but imagining it differently. We do not need to look the same, we can be proud of our individuality. This is what collage represents.</h3> 
><h3>"I love this aspect of collage because I do not feel the pressure to conform nor follow traditional conventions of art making and creating. In the same way, I resist against the conventions of people’s perspectives of me as a woman, I find freedom in collage."</h3>
