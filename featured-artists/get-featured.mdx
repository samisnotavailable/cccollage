# Get Featured

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

**cccollage** isn't just an educational or resource site, but instead it serves two purposes: first as an introduction and ode to collage as an artform, and second as a directory for existing collage artists, especially in the Philippines. With that being said, my goal with this website is to create a directory for collage artists to get to know each other better and for the public to also easily find them. Think of it as like a central, public database. There are two ways to get featured here:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="first-way" label="Method No. 1" default>
    > If I come across your works myself and ask you if you want to get featured.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="second-way" label="Method No. 2">
    > If you sign up through the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/jXtcBwi31S9sRQXw6).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

I like following collage artists, so it's highly likely I'll stumble upon you first before you ever stumble upon cccollage! However, if that isn't the case and you would like to get featured, you may do so through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/jXtcBwi31S9sRQXw6) that I've linked. Anyone can register, and I don't want to restrict anyone from not getting featured, but I feel some basic requirements are a must:

- *You **MUST** have created the collages yourself*
- *You **MUST** have a minimum of three collages. This is just to incentivize you to make more than one!*
- *You **MUST** have a social media account or website where you can be contacted by me*
- *You **MUST NOT** be a bigot, homophobe, misogynist, sexist, or have caused any public or sexual harassment. Just don't be a bastard.* 

And that's pretty much it. Please note though, that before featuring you here, I will be contacting you first, and so please give me time before I reach out to you. My priority is to also feature Filipino or SEA collage artists, so if you're from outside this region, you will also have to bear some patience.

If you're curious as to what the Google Form entails but don't want to click it yet, it's only one page, and all I'll ask for are your:
- Name / Artist Name
- Social Media Link 
- Country of Residence
- Artworks
- A personal quote from you

*But Diende,* you say, *where's the bio? Where does the bio come from?* As you can see with the Featured Artists here, every bio is written by me. This is a way for me to keep things a little unique for everyone and also so that it can actually feel like you're being featured, like a guest in my home! Definitely please come forward with any notes you may want me to include about yourself in the bio though. If I get too many submissions, I may change the rules, but that's what it is now.

So, what are you waiting for? I've linked this like two times now. [Get featured here!](https://forms.gle/jXtcBwi31S9sRQXw6)
