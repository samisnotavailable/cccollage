# Sean Eidder

Sean Eidder is a creative director and collage artist. I got to know about him when he and I both got featured on Novice Magazine (a Filipino magazine that bears its name from Nueva Viscaya) for its fourth issue. Personally, I really connected with his collage artworks right upon discovering them. I think the way he's able to communicate his ideas with so much control of collage sources (whether in a maximalist or minimalist artwork) in part due to his creative design skills always impress me. My favorites in this album he sent me are the first and fourth collages you'll see on this page.
