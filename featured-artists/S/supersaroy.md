# Supersaroy

Supersaroy makes these really fun, eye-catching collages—filled to the edge of the paper with the smallest, intentional details. I think what I really love about her collages is that she utilizes what we in Filipino call *anik-anik*—this collection of all the things we earn, own, and keep throughout our lives—and dedicates her memory or experience of them as a collective through collage. Which makes so much sense: what is collage, if not a collection of all the things we love?

> <h3>"Collage was like a form of art therapy for me when I started in the pandemic. I enjoyed how I could be allowed to put pretty things together and it be turned into a huge art vomit. One that I understood completely and defined later on as I'd give my piece a name. I love to collage because it feels like the closest thing to taking a picture of what my thoughts look like at that time. It's like scrapbooking but the subject is the loud noises in my head."</h3>
