Collage also requires skill to perform, but if you want to see the results of what you envisioned, as long as you have the right collage pieces, you may more or less get close to your imagination, even as a beginner.

There\u2019s something personally special about finding something and learning about it, only to find yourself in a rabbit hole of new information and perspectives. I think that exploration can sustain you in doing collages, because the more you find new sources, the more you can see what they were made for and how to use them.
