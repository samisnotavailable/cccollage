I personally worked under BPC for two years as a Graphic Designer, and when most of my work there was not involved in branding or logo work, I was mostly involved with creating collages. Collages, due to their easier form than illustration, are often used in commercial or journalistic settings to easily add a little flavor or support to the actual, primary content on the page. But the collages from BPC have really grown in the past few years, taking a more artistic leaning, with plenty of them able to display the meaning of the article without that article's context. In other words: they stand on their own, and are worth highlighting as collage works and as pieces of art themselves (even without my bias.)"}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The works shown here range from article banners, holiday visuals, magazine artworks, to promotional materials.
