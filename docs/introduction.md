# Introduction

## Who Am I?

Hi! My name is **Diende Noel.** You may also just call me Diende. I've been creating collages and multimedia artworks under this moniker for around 4 years now, and the work just continues to grow as I continue to love it.

Making collages and (quite recently) doing papercraft has become a huge interest and passion in my life, and I’ve had the honor to make collages in both professional and personal settings. I've done a lot of editorial work, personal artworks, and even commissioned collages, and since I'm developing a portfolio, I thought I could use all the notes and resources I've been gathering to come up with a decent website dedicated to collage-making.

## What's collage?

Collage, according to [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collage), comes in two definitions:
> **1.** an artistic composition made of various materials (such as paper, cloth, or wood) glued on a surface

> **2.** a creative work that resembles such a composition in incorporating various materials or elements

I will discuss more of this later, but this is a good place to start. Unlike most art forms, collage art often depends on other art as a source. Keep that in mind.

## Why do I love collage?

Well actually, I didn’t start off by loving collage. Collage-making to me is really more of an offset rather than a direct result of what I actually love to do: which is archiving. Since I was a kid, I loved collecting little scraps of notes, letters, newspaper cutouts, posters, or just trash I refused to throw away (cleaned though, don’t worry). It might be from a gift I received, a trip I took, or anything that looked remotely interesting enough to keep, and I’d tuck them away in “memorabilia boxes” around my room. 

Then I took an art class, in which one of our projects was to make our own collage. Although that was my first exposure to the collage artform, it didn’t quite stick with me yet. 

Eventually, my memorabilia boxes turned digital. I started to love the idea of exploring websites–especially the more forum-styled ones before social media engulfed our internet–and finding these gems that people post and obsess about. There are pictures, artworks, and even paintings that I’ve found on some websites with no other copy anywhere else–and knowing that nothing really stays even in this digital age, I’d save them on the family laptop. Eventually the obsession gradually started snowballing: I’d go through Wikipedia articles, public domain sites, and start saving things on my own computer (now a hard drive, for safekeeping), until finally I started thinking, <em>“I’d love to do a collage with this.”</em>

Ever since then, archiving has become a lot more serious for me: a way to keep a preservation of digital copies, ad as I’d archive more and more, I’d also continue making more collages. The snowball has become a boulder of which I’d happily keep pushing.

## Goal of this Website

Archiving, to me, comes from an inherent desire to preserve what I love, but collage comes from a desire to honor and pay tribute to the same things I love.

Every collage artwork is very much about the parts as much as it is the sum of its parts. Collage is an act of both reclamation–to make what came before as your own–and dedication–an ode to the artists that help make your art now.

What I want to do, at the most, is to get you started in doing collages. At the very least, I just want to spotlight my own love for collage, to make you understand it, and to hopefully swoon you enough that you would appreciate it–perhaps even encourage you to try it.
