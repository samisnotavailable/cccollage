# What to Expect

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '5px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This project took me a total of four months—from concept, coding, to writing—in between my own graduation and then work. But in reality, this project is the result of my many years doing collage.

With that being said, I don't think I am finished. I don't expect <Highlight color="black">cccollage</Highlight> to ever finish, as I continue to work and create many more collages and find many more resources I can trust. There may be a time my opinions will shift, and I may change some things here and there, but whatever I have said now, I believe, will always remain true to me. 

Please trust that future updates will come, and they will come soon! One thing you can always expect is for [Featured Artists](../featured-artists/get-featured) to constantly be updated as much as I can. I would love to populate this site with as many referrals to current and existing collage artists as possible, so we can have a directory of artists to support. 
Another thing to expect is that I will always do my best to make this website as accessible for everyone, as much as possible, even within the limits of my coding skills. 

## What to Look Forward to

For now, you may use this page as a reference for what you can expect in the upcoming updates:
- First blog post to be populated
- Filipino translation of the current **cccollage** documentation
- Video version of the tutorial in getting your first collage done

And still many more after that, so make sure to stick around!
