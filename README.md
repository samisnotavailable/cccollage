# Website

cccollage (or Crash Course Collage) is a free website tool aimed to get you, dear reader, interested in collage as both an artform and as a practice. At the very least, I want to spotlight my own love for collage, make you understand it, and hopefully swoon you enough that you would appreciate it.

### Build

This website was created with the help of Docusaurus, Markdown, and a whole lot of Javascript. Feel free to use it as a reference for your own blog!

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
